UMASL MATLAB image reconstruction/processing toolbox
by Luis Hernandez-Garcia and David Frey @ University of Michigan 2022

This directory contains tools for image reconstruction and processing in
MATLAB

To get started, you can run
'addpath(genpath('{PATH TO REPO}/MATLAB_repo'))' to add all functions
and scripts into your path

This directory contains the following subdirectories:
- fmri (FMRI processing, such as GLM tools and compcor)
- generic (high-level functions that can apply to most functions even
    outside umasl)
- img (image file reading, writing, and display functions)
- kspace (functions focused on processing kspace data such as
    reconstruction)
- mrf (functions for mri fingerprinting)
- quant (functions for ASL quantification)
- tools (GUI-based tools such as FASL and ORTHO)

This directory has some dependencies which vary from function to function,
which are included in the documentation (help message) of each function.
The most commonly used dependencies are:
- spm12 (git@github.com/spm/spm12.git)
- mirt (git@github.com/JeffFessler/mirt.git)
- MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox
